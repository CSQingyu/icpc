	// For each circle, project a horizontal line through its center and
	// calculate the x-coordinate of all intersections with all circles. The
	// circles with an intersection both left and right of the center is a
	// circle that is either included in or includes the current circle, and
	// thus an extra tint is needed. The line that needs most tints shows the
	// number of needed tints.
	// To optimize, make two sorted lists, one sorted on the y-coord of the
	// center and one sorted on the y-coord of the top. Traverse through the
	// circles in the list sorted on the centers, and find intersections in the
	// list with circles sorted on the tops. Now you can prevent checking
	// circles that do not intersect with the line.
	// O(n^2) (but somewhat faster then the tree-method)
